# Privacy Policy

**Nuvopad** by Cybesis Studios  
**Last Updated:** February 16, 2026

---

## TL;DR

**Nuvopad is a privacy-first, offline-first application.** All your data stays on your device. We don't collect, store, or share your personal information. Your notes are yours alone.

---

## 1. Overview

Cybesis Studios ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Nuvopad ("the App") handles your information. By using Nuvopad, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Personal Data

**Nuvopad does not collect any personal data.** The App operates entirely offline and does not transmit any user information to our servers or third parties.

### 2.2 Usage Data

Nuvopad does not collect analytics, telemetry, or usage statistics. We do not track:

- How you use the App
- What features you interact with
- How often you open the App
- Any diagnostic or crash reports (unless explicitly shared by you)

### 2.3 Content Data

All content you create in Nuvopad (notes, notebooks, tags, attachments) is stored locally on your device in:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\CybesisStudios.Nuvopad\`

This data is **never transmitted** to external servers, cloud services, or third parties. You have complete control over your data.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

**We don't.** Since Nuvopad doesn't collect any information, there is no data to use, process, or analyze.

---

## 4. Data Storage and Security

### 4.1 Local Storage

All your notes and settings are stored locally in a SQLite database on your device. This data is:

- Stored only on your local file system
- Never uploaded to any server
- Not synchronized across devices (since there is no cloud service)
- Subject to your device's file system permissions and security

### 4.2 Data Security

Since all data remains on your device, the security of your information depends on:

- Your device's security settings (password, encryption, etc.)
- Your operating system's security measures
- Physical access controls to your device

**We recommend keeping your device secure and encrypted to protect your notes.**

---

## 5. Third-Party Services

Nuvopad does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or analytics platforms. The App operates completely offline and independently.

### 5.1 Microsoft Store (Windows Only)

If you downloaded Nuvopad from the Microsoft Store, Microsoft may collect certain information about the download and installation process. This is governed by [Microsoft's Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement), not ours.

### 5.2 In-App Purchase (Pro Version)

If you purchase the Pro version through the Microsoft Store, the transaction is handled entirely by Microsoft. We do not collect or store any payment information. Microsoft's payment processing is governed by their privacy policy.

The Pro license status is verified locally on your device using Microsoft Store APIs. No personal or payment information is sent to us.

---

## 6. Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any user data because we don't collect any.**

There are no circumstances under which we would share your data with third parties, law enforcement, or other entities, because we have no access to your data.

---

## 7. Children's Privacy

Nuvopad does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. Since the App doesn't collect any data at all, it is safe for users of all ages.

---

## 8. Your Rights

Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:

- **Access:** Your data is stored in `%APPDATA%\CybesisStudios.Nuvopad\`
- **Deletion:** You can delete all data by uninstalling the App or manually deleting the data folder
- **Backup:** You can manually back up your data folder
- **Export:** Use the App's export feature to save notes in Markdown or JSON format

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

Major changes will be communicated through:

- The App's "About" dialog
- Our GitHub repository
- Microsoft Store listing updates (if applicable)

---

Nuvopad is open source software. You can review the source code to verify our privacy claims:
